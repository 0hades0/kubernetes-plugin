    By selecting "Requires Permission" you have to explicitly grant Pipeline Jobs the permission to use this cloud.
    The permission can be granted by selecting this cloud in the Kubernetes Plugin Section of the folder configuration.
    All Pipeline Jobs in the folder and its children will then be granted permission to use this cloud.
