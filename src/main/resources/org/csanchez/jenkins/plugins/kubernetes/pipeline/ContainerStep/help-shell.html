<p>
    Specifies a shell which will run inside the container
    and process requests from Jenkins to run executables,
    set environment variables, and similar infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    This does <strong>not</strong> affect the shell used to run user code,
    such as <code>sh</code> steps.
    To run your scripts with a specific shell, use an interpreter line:
</p>
<pre><code>
sh '''#!/bin/bash
for x in {0..9}; do echo x; done
'''
</code></pre>
<p>
    Defaults to <code>sh</code>, which should be in <code>$PATH</code>.
    Should not generally be overridden.
