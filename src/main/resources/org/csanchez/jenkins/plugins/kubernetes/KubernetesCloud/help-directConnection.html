  When this option is enabled a <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/tcpAgent.md#connect-directly-to-tcp-port">direct connection</a>
  is established from the agent to the TCP agent listener on the master, without the usual initial http request to get the required connection parameters.
  All parameters (like TCP agent listener port and instance identity) are directly passed to the agent.
  This is useful in scenarios where the master does not expose an http port, for example <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner">Jenkinsfile Runner</a>.
